# GENESIS-PW-001 — Primordial Emergence Experiment

## Purpose

Test whether persistent relational structures can emerge from local oscillator rules without hard-coding entities, language, goals, meaning, or intelligence.

## Universe

The GENESIS universe contains only oscillator state and local interaction rules. The observer is external and measurement-only.

### GENESIS-1.0

- 16x16 periodic lattice = 256 oscillators
- deterministic seed: 390001
- local four-neighbour coupling
- deterministic noise
- 100,000 ticks
- global coherence measurement

### GENESIS-1.1

The external observer adds a local coherence field and connected-region detection.

A detected coherent region is **not an entity**. It is an observer measurement. The universe does not store cluster labels and detection does not modify oscillator phases.

### GENESIS-1.2

The observer adds persistence, lifetime, boundary contrast, and Jaccard identity overlap.

Region identity is assigned by the observer using spatial overlap only. It is not part of the universe state.

### GENESIS-1.3

The observer adds a lifecycle event stream:

- **birth** — a measured region has no qualifying predecessor.
- **growth** — a tracked region gains cells.
- **decay** — a tracked region loses cells.
- **split** — one predecessor overlaps multiple current regions.
- **merge** — one current region overlaps multiple predecessors.
- **death** — a predecessor has no qualifying successor.

These are observer-level classifications of measured region sets. They are not causal mechanisms inside the universe.

## Measurement rule

For regions A and B:

J(A,B) = |A intersection B| / |A union B|

A current region inherits a previous identity when J(A,B) >= overlap_threshold and that previous identity has not already been assigned in the current frame.

Lifecycle events are then derived from the overlap graph between consecutive observation frames.

## Non-interference rule

GENESIS-1.3 must not:

- write identities or lifecycle events into GenesisUniverse
- modify phase, frequency, amplitude, coupling, or noise
- introduce endogenous memory
- introduce goals, meaning, language, agency, or self-models

The next experimental question is whether lifecycle traces provide a useful substrate for an external memory layer and later predictive measurements.
